This is a CLI chat client for the game hackmud based around the ability to chat via JSON.

How to use:

  /user <user> -> switch to user, invalid user will crash
  /channel <channel> -> switch channel, invalid channel will make the program very confused
  /quit -> quit the program
  {coming soon} /help -> display this
```
